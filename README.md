Personal Portfolio

The objective of this homework was to create a professional portfolio of the work we've completed in the course, provide contact information, and link to a resume.

I'll continue to evolve this throughout the bootcamp.

Technologies:

Bootstrap

Future Improvements:

Contact Form - Simple, Bootstrap native mailto form
Navigation Improvements - Fix the smooth scrolling and change color in Nav Bar to contrast with page background
PDF modal - Resume pop-up, rather than brower URL
Larger text - More Bootstrap native improvements
